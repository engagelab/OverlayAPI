Some of Modest Maps JS is experimental, and under active development. These examples reflect this exploration, and occasionally use external libraries (like jquery, raphael, excanvas and dojo) that the core Modest Maps code does not depend on.

Plans involve experimentation with the following:

* SVG and Canvas drawing
* Webkit/Gecko CSS transforms/animations
* IE CSS filters.
* arbitrary zoom levels
* rotations
* touch events
* ipad/iphone/ipod/android support

Contributions are welcome! Please contact us via github (file an issue or message @RandomEtc, @migurski or @tmcw) if you would like to get involved.
